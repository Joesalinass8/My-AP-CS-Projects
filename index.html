      <p><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/880805521">Dodge The Dog Scratch Game</a></p>
      <p>This is my final project for my summer homework on scratch. I created a video game where you have to move the
        guy
        around the field for a certain amount of time, while dodging all the multiplying dogs that are trying to eat
        you.

      <p>I created a project with math. I created my own custom blocks to get the maximun of lists, the minimum, the
        average, sum, and integer.

      <p>This was my AP Create Project called "RecipeBook". The premise of the project was that you could easily input the type of food you wanted, such as breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert. The program then cycles through 3 different recipes depending on which type of food you selected, and then outputs the recipe to you. Also, the program will never a repeat a recipe during the use of the program, but may repeat if the program is closed and opened.

      <p>My teamate and I created a code that is able to produce color. We made the code more advanced and turned it into a stoplight, as it changed from red, green, and yellow just like one you see everyday. After completing that we made a code that would produce a rainbow wheel. it gave all the colors on the rainbow and then would make them all spin around the wheel in a fast pace.

      <p>This is my final Genius hour project that I created for second semester. There was a new topic introudced to us which was pcb boards that we were able to create and even get them ourselves. I decidedti make a business card with my name on it, kinktree QR code, and many cool pictures that I like. When you scan the QR code in the picture, it will bring up my linktree, but I added a NFC chip into it to make it scan everytung while it taps on your phone.
